## Job View & Add

### Introduction

Web app where job applicants can keep tracker of positions that they apply for, keep track of the people that they meet through the application process and create an application checklist.

### Usage

View the app here [https://my-3rjob.herokuapp.com](https://my-3rjob.herokuapp.com).

Or clone the repo and then install the needed gems locally:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
